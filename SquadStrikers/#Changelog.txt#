0.1.2:

Changed sizes of UI elements to better work with varied resolutions
Cleaned up display of Message Log at bottom of screen (removed jerkiness).
Fixed bug where enemies moving onto Substance X could collect it for you.
Changed default zoom level so the whole board fits on screen at any resolution.
Fixed bug where score undefined when the score display tried to render the first time.
Added More/Less Feature to message log.
Added hotkeys.

0.1.3:

Added pause menu. Moved quit button to it.
Left hand stat bar now recognizes and displays the difference between base and conditional attributes.
Left hand stat bar now colour codes HP and Energy displays based on amount remaining.
Left hand stat bar now adds up unit and weapon stats so you don't have to.
Can now end turn whenever (when choosing an action or a target). This defaults the choice to doing nothing.
Restructured the code for the Left Hand Side Display allowing it to be extended more easily.
Fixed Action button sizes to scale appropriately for low screen resolution.
Fixed hotkeys wiping stat display.
Fixed Bow Mastery and Power blow bonuses displays.
Left hand stat bar now displays target information on mouse over.

0.1.4

Added permadeath save games and all required support for it.

0.1.5

Gameplay:
Discharging Ancient Magics now takes no time, while Activating them now takes time.

UI:
Rewrote Targeting section of the code. It went from a dozen methods to three and reduced code by about 200 lines.
Should also be easier to extend and modify now, making the following round of UI changes much easier to implement.
Made every ability targetable. Previously untargetable abilities are self targetable.
Clicking on an ability or pressing the hotkey selects it, highlighting possible targets, rather than activating it.
When choosing targets, other abilities are displayed and can be chosen, rather than having to first choose cancel.

Bugfix:
Fixed a bug where Generic Goon, Chasers, Elite Chasers and The Destroyer all had the name "Generic Goon", leading to incorrect displays and saving and loading considering them interchangable.

0.1.6:

Gameplay:
Now possible to stand on level exit. Leaving level is an action.

UI:
Added support for undoing moves. Cannot undo once an action is performed, even an instant one or a do nothing.
As with units, right clicking on items now brings up a description on the left.
Added hotkeys to end turn: Enter, Space.

Bugfixes:
Fixed bug where whether you could pick up an item or leave the level was based on where you were before moving, rather than after.
Fixed a bug where if a character died, you save and then load, they appear at (1,1) but otherwise cannot be interacted with.
Fixed a bug where if a character acted, then the game was saved and loaded, they appeared to have not acted but still cannot act again.

0.1.7

UI:
Added tiles that could be targetted if there was a valid target on them getting highlighted mildly.
Added targetting support for tile targettable abilities.
Fixed bug in bow targetting resulting from rounding errors with floats by adding or subtracting 0.0001 to some calculations. (I had been adding Mathf.Epsilon, but the rounding errors were considerably larger than this.)
Removed "Cannot perform this action" message and action cancelling when no valid targets found. Instead, a warning comes up but the ability is still selected. However, it cannot be used due to not being able to pick a target. This combined with the highlighted tiles should allow for easier rangefinding.

Known issues:
Mouse over enemy/item to see on left hand panel. <- Not sure if actually a good idea.
InactiveTargeting modes currently do nothing.
Highlighting for tiles should be done via colour filter, not diferent sprite.
Need ability to scroll when there are too many actions
Border highlighting for selection, rather than colour tweaking.
Careful Strike Bonus does not carry over between levels.
