0.1.2:

Changed sizes of UI elements to better work with varied resolutions
Cleaned up display of Message Log at bottom of screen (removed jerkiness).
Fixed bug where enemies moving onto Substance X could collect it for you.
Changed default zoom level so the whole board fits on screen at any resolution.
Fixed bug where score undefined when the score display tried to render the first time.
Added More/Less Feature to message log.
Added hotkeys.

0.1.3:

Added pause menu. Moved quit button to it.
Left hand stat bar now recognizes and displays the difference between base and conditional attributes.
Left hand stat bar now colour codes HP and Energy displays based on amount remaining.
Left hand stat bar now adds up unit and weapon stats so you don't have to.
Can now end turn whenever (when choosing an action or a target). This defaults the choice to doing nothing.
Restructured the code for the Left Hand Side Display allowing it to be extended more easily.
Fixed Action button sizes to scale appropriately for low screen resolution.
Fixed hotkeys wiping stat display.
Fixed Bow Mastery and Power blow bonuses displays.
Left hand stat bar now displays target information on mouse over.

0.1.4

Added permadeath save games and all required support for it.

0.1.5

Gameplay:
Discharging Ancient Magics now takes no time, while Activating them now takes time.

UI:
Rewrote Targeting section of the code. It went from a dozen methods to three and reduced code by about 200 lines.
Should also be easier to extend and modify now, making the following round of UI changes much easier to implement.
Made every ability targetable. Previously untargetable abilities are self targetable.
Clicking on an ability or pressing the hotkey selects it, highlighting possible targets, rather than activating it.
When choosing targets, other abilities are displayed and can be chosen, rather than having to first choose cancel.

Bugfix:
Fixed a bug where Generic Goon, Chasers, Elite Chasers and The Destroyer all had the name "Generic Goon", leading to incorrect displays and saving and loading considering them interchangable.

0.1.6:

Gameplay:
Now possible to stand on level exit. Leaving level is an action.

UI:
Added support for undoing moves. Cannot undo once an action is performed, even an instant one or a do nothing.
As with units, right clicking on items now brings up a description on the left.
Added hotkeys to end turn: Enter, Space

Bugfixes:
Fixed bug where whether you could pick up an item or leave the level was based on where you were before moving, rather than after.
Fixed a bug where if a character died, you save and then load, they appear at (1,1) but otherwise cannot be interacted with.
Fixed a bug where if a character acted, then the game was saved and loaded, they appeared to have not acted but still cannot act again.

0.2.0:

NOTE: SAVES FROM OLDER VERSIONS INCOMPATIBLE.

Gameplay:
Changed Bow Mastery to allow arcing shots over people's heads. It might be a bit underpowered but it was more interesting than the placeholder +Acc,+Dmg I had because I couldn't think of anything.
Significantly reduced probability of very out of depth item drops.
Dreamatically reduced the amount that the spawn rate of enemies and items depends on depth, as well as on rng.

UI: 
Added ability to undo movement.
Added faint highlighting of tiles that are in the correct range for an ability but are not valid targets due to not having the right type of thing on them (ex: a Unit).
Added support for abilities targetted to floors or walls.
All abilities now targeted. Abilities that don't need a target target the self. As such, all abilites take two button presses, rather than some taking 2 and some 1.
Now allows entering targeting mode when there are no valid targets, rather than immediately cancelling. Should be less jarring and along with the faint highlighting above, allow for easier rangefinding.
When targeting an ability, all other abilities still visible and can be selected rather than having to click Cancel first.
Pressing an ability hotkey, pressing enter, or clicking on that ability's button when the ability is selected now automatically selects a default target.
Added hotkeys to select a unit to move. Pressing it twice stays still.
Selecting a unit who has already moved now gives a warning.
The hotkey Spacebar now ends your turn.
Cleaned up Pause Menu
On character creator screen, added options to delete a save game and to save your starting configuration as your default.

Bugfixes:
Fixed bug with bow targeting resulting from rounding errors in floating point calculations by increasing rounding tolerances from 2*Mathf.Epsilon to 0.0001.
Fixed bug where you cannot move to a tile with an item as the item hitboxes added in 0.1.6 blocked the tile hitboxes.
Fixed bug where Numpad didn't work for numerical hotkeys, no matter the state of Num Lock.
Fixed a bug where saving and loading would reset ancient magics to inactive.
Fixed a bug where one-use instants (ex: Discharging an Ancient Magic) didn't get removed from the action list on use.
Fixed a bug where all Ancient Magics had been set to 0 max charges.
Fixed a bug where the game didn't save on the first turn of each level, allowing one to easily save scum level randomization from within the game.

Backend:
Movement now resolved in the same way as action targeting.

0.2.1:

Gameplay:
Completely overhauled level generation algorithms to increase level variety and make unreachable points impossible.
Added some of the backend framework (the level generation related part) for a variety of level objective modes.
Improved Item spawning algorithms so roughly the same total value of items will always spawn at any given depth.
Improved Enemy spawning algorithms so roughly the same total difficulty of enemies will always spawn at any given depth.

Bugfixes:
Level generation now creates the entire level before instantiating any of it, so you should no longer see the flicker of levels being created and destroyed when invalid.

Backend:
Moved all of the level generation code to a separate class, rather than being in the Board Handler class.
Additionally, cleaned up some cruft in the Board Handler class. These two combined to reduce it from well over 2000 lines to 1424.

0.2.2

Gameplay:
Can only leave levels through exit tile by default in Sprint, Optional Boss or Treasure Hunt level objectives.
Sprint still the only level type that can be generated.

Known issues:
Each level objective needs to actually work:
-Regular enemy spawning and agro should be happening in Survive type.
-Victory should occur after a certain time in Survive type.
-Kill counter needs to be added for Slaughter type.
-Bosses need to be implemented.
-Optional Bosses need to be implemented.
-KeyCollect tracker and verifier need to work.
-Pressing buttons needs to work.
-Buttons need to end game if not enough living squad members.
-Treasure hunts need to be added.
-Working objectives need to be enabled in BoardGenerator.
UI needs to display objectives.
Art needed for keys, buttons and treasure maps.
The same boss shouldn't spawn more than once.
Guards should be coded to preferentially spawn in doorways.
Mage mana regen too high
Arrow key based targeting should be possible to allow complete keyboard play.
Need ability to scroll when there are too many actions or save files available.
Character creation screen needs tooltips
Careful Strike Bonus does not carry over between levels.
