Left hand stat bar now adds up unit and weapon stats so you don't have to.

0.1.5

Gameplay:
Discharging Ancient Magics now takes no time, while Activating them now takes time.

UI:
Rewrote Targeting section of the code. It went from a dozen methods to three and reduced code by about 200 lines.
Should also be easier to extend and modify now, making the following round of UI changes much easier to implement.
Made every ability targetable. Previously untargetable abilities are self targetable.
Clicking on an ability or pressing the hotkey selects it, highlighting possible targets, rather than activating it.
When choosing targets, other abilities are displayed and can be chosen, rather than having to first choose cancel.

Bugfix:
Fixed a bug where Generic Goon, Chasers, Elite Chasers and The Destroyer all had the name "Generic Goon", leading to incorrect displays and saving and loading considering them interchangable.


Known issues:
If a character dies, you save and then load, they appear at (1,1) but otherwise cannot be interacted with.
Characters who have already acted have their colour restored after saving and loading (though they still cannot act).
Cannot cancel move actions.
Right clicking on items should bring up on Left Hand panel.
Mouse over enemy/item to see on left hand panel.
InactiveTargeting modes currently do nothing. Neither do Tile targeting modes.
